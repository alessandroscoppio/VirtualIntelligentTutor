I have also tried different implementations ways to load data in this fucking module:
- https://github.com/siyuanzhao/2016-EDM
- https://github.com/davidoj/deepknowledgetracingTF

and of course dkt+, the latest and better model so far:
- https://github.com/ckyeungac/deep-knowledge-tracing-plus/blob/master/load_data.py

all of them have in common 2 things:
    - they all use some sort of custom data manager to train the network, something like DataGenerator
        or BatchGenerator or some object that deals internally with batches size, current batch, 
        crossvalidation, test and validation data, etc.
    - even if implemented in different ways and with DIFFERENT OUTPUTS sometimes,
        we want our data to look like this:

        INPUT:  array/tensor with dims: (batch_size, ??, 2*n_problems)
        OUTPUT: array/tensor with dims: (1, n_problems)

I'm going to sleep because I did computer vision till 6 and my head does not work anymore,
please take a look at our code, the github pages I linked and let's try to make this thing run :D    

I suggest to read documentation of:
    Logits
    Masking layer
    fit_generator / train on batch
    everything is not really clear when you see it.


    Once data is loaded in the correct format, the model should run smoothly, model layer/parameters
    have been cross checked with multiple implementation, especially Keras based ones:
    - https://github.com/CAHLR/DKT_pre
    - https://github.com/mmkhajah/dkt/blob/master/dkt.py (this seems the easier one)

    please have a look at them, I may have missed something important and we could still look it up to compare

Ibro:
I have commented out this model and put the one below,
which is https://github.com/LiangbeiXu/Deep-Knowledge-Tracing/blob/master/src/StudentModel.py
I also created folders saved_models and logs because the model below requires it.
